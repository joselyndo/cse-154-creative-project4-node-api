    Sunflowers are originally from North America and have been cultivated
    for over 4,500 years. This is partly because the entirety of the
    sunflower plant is edible, so the leaves, stalks, and roots could all
    be used as food. In fact, sunflowers were grown as food in North America
    before other crops such as corn became commonplace.
